my mind so insecure..<br />
i always reminding your face...<br />
i wanna be with u..until the end of my life..<br />
just wanna be with u..i wanna be with u</p>

<p>i'm here to stay..just waiting for u..<br />
don't u know that u're always dance in all my dream..<br />
i'm here to stay..just waiting for u..<br />
don't u know that I miss u..</p>
<p>my heart say your name<br />

<p>I miss u..I wanna hug u<br />
and tell u how much I love u<br />
and say "I can't live without u"</p>
<p>I miss u..I wanna reach u..<br />
and touch your soul just to say "I need u"<br />
and I don.t wanna leave u..</p>
<p>I miss u...</p>
